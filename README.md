# HYDROELECTRIC-PROJECT-HMI

This project simulates a control system for a simplified hydroelectric power plant using *TIA Portal*.  
It was developed to demonstrate skills in PLC programming and HMI development for real-time industrial applications.

## 🔧 Project Overview
The system reads analog and digital signals from a simulated environment and responds with automated control actions to ensure safe and efficient operation.  
An intuitive HMI interface enables the operator to monitor the system status and interact with various control elements.

## 📂 Contents
- Multiple folders containing screenshots and logic code organized by function:
  - *HMI Screens*
  - *Control System*
  - *Safety Logic (Alarms, Emergency Stop, Brake Failure, etc.)*
  - *Analog Inputs (Speed, Temperature, Flow, etc.)*
- Full project compressed in PROJECT FILE.zip

## 🎯 Key Features
- Integration of analog/digital input signals with real-time control logic.
- Emergency handling logic and safe shut-down sequences.
- Dynamic HMI screens for live system visualization and user control.
- Simulation-ready logic with detailed feedback loops.

## 📁 How to Use
1. Download and extract PROJECT FILE.zip
2. Open the project using *Siemens TIA Portal*
3. Review OB1 logic and HMI screens
4. Simulate or upload to PLC hardware
